# v0.3.2

- Include the `.ts` file in the distribution for better debugging experience.

# v0.3.1

- Breaking changes:
    - Re-design the API from scratch:
        - Now `zoom` and `zoomNoSet` are the only APIs that `ReadableTree`/`WriteableTree` adds to `Readable`/`Writable`.
            - `zoom` accepts an `Accessor` object, which contains `readChild` and `writeChild`.
            - `zoomNoSet` accepts a `readChild` function to return `ReadableTree`.
        - New `Accessor` class can replace `zoomIn`, `choose`, etc, and it's composable with the `and` method.
        - `ReadableTree` is now "writable" in its children: `ReadableTree`'s `zoom`ed tree can be `set`.
- üìù Documentation changes etc:
    - Update the description to include "nested stores" as its keyword
    - Add how to install
